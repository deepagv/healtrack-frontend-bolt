# HealTrack Frontend (Design Export)

This repo contains the Figma-exported frontend code and assets.

## Structure
- `src/` – code (components, styles, utils, supabase client, App.tsx)
- `public/assets/` – images, icons, fonts (add later as needed)
- `docs/` – design docs (ATTRIBUTIONS.md, guidelines)

> Note: This is a design export. It may need a build tool (like React/Vite) to run as a site.
